# Image-Classification-with-Keras
## Problem Statement
The objective of this project is to classify the images using convolutional neural network and optimize the architecture for better accuracy.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is CMU face images. This dataset consists of faces of 20 different persons with two different variation combinations in each picture. The two different combinations include orientation(straight, right, left, up, down) and expression(sad, neutral, happy, angry).
